Automated Vulnerability Detection in Code using the Gemma-2b Model from the Unsloth Library


# Description
This project focuses on utilizing the Gemma-2b model from the Unsloth library to automatically detect vulnerabilities in code. The model is trained using a dataset containing vulnerable and patched code, and during the fine-tuning process, cosine similarity between the two code versions is calculated to determine whether vulnerabilities exist. The Gemma-2b model applies 4-bit quantization to maximize memory efficiency, and the AdamW optimizer is used for fine-tuning. The trained model is then evaluated using a test dataset, where it assesses the similarity between vulnerable and patched code to generate accurate vulnerability detection results. Finally, the fine-tuned model is saved for future inference, allowing for efficient and fast analysis of code vulnerabilities.
