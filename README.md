Automated Vulnerability Detection in Code using the Gemma-2b Model from the Unsloth Library


# Description
Supply chain security is emerging as the latest security trend, and companies are quickly devising countermeasures. However, they are using libraries that are already installed in the internal network or registered in the package manager without much suspicion. However, not all libraries or modules registered in the package manager are normal files, so we developed a chatbot-type source code vulnerability diagnosis tool using Gemma, and actually detected malicious packages and libraries in package managers such as npm and pypi.
